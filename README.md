# Optimal_Execution_Cost
Deep Learning Approximation for Optimal Portfolio Execution Costs.

This thesis addresses the challenge of minimizing execution costs in portfolio management, a problem arising from the need to execute large trades across multiple securities without significantly impacting market prices. Traditional dynamic programming methods struggle with the "curse of dimensionality" in such high-dimensional stochastic control problems. To overcome this, the thesis adopts a deep learning approach, leveraging artificial neural networks to approximate optimal trading strategies.

Using a finite time horizon model, neural networks are trained to split large orders optimally over time, achieving high accuracy in minimizing execution costs. The approach also demonstrates broad applicability to other fields, such as resource allocation and dynamic game theory. The thesis provides a thorough exploration of the underlying machine learning theory, execution cost modeling, and implementation details, culminating in a performance analysis of the neural network's effectiveness in approximating optimal trade sequences.
